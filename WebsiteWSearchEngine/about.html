        Giphy Explorer lets you search for GIFs and browse trending animations
        using the GIPHY API. Built by a systems engineer turned tech adventurer,
        this app reflects a passion for creative problem solving, interactive
        design, and generative AI exploration.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a student passionate about blending creativity with
        technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project â€” <strong>Giphy Explorer</strong> â€” was built to showcase
        my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while exploring the Giphy API to
        deliver fun and dynamic GIF content. It's more than just search â€” it's
        about learning how to combine design, functionality, and user experience
        into one interactive application.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm particularly interested in front-end development and generative AI,
        and this app reflects my growth in coding and problem-solving. Building
        the dark mode toggle, custom navigation bar, and dynamic loading
        features gave me insight into how small tweaks can create a smoother,
        more enjoyable experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks for checking out my project â€” hope it brings a smile, a laugh, or
        at least a really cool GIF to your screen. ðŸ˜„
